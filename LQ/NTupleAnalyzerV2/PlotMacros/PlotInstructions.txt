####   Plot Macro Use In The NTupleAnalyzerV2 Framework   ####
##############################################################

If you have succesfully run the NTupleAnalyzer with the AnalyzerMakerFast.py
facility with "Group" labels in the input CSV file, then in addition to the
Castor directory in which the output of the individual jobs in stored, there
is a subdirectory labelled "SummaryFiles", in which there are simplified
root files which make plotting and further analysis easier. These root files
look something like "zjets.root", "ttbar.root", etc. 

These plotting macros like "MakePlotsMuNuSub.C" have a plotting routine which
can be called multiple times for variables which are output from the analyzer
code. The default macro has 40some plots. 

It relies on the "LoadCastorFiles.C", a file which will load the files and 
trees into memory from the SummaryFiles on castor. In this file you can 
change the Castor directories or root files. 

These should run out-of-the-box, and give a nice re-useable skeleton for
getting numbers and plots from histograms. The default code also calculates
scale factors in the standard way. So you can implement a mass region 
cut (commented out by default) and just run the mass plot, and part of
the screen output will be a "normalization factor" which can tell you 
how you will need to scale the Z (MuMu analysis) or W (MuNu analysis). 
Of course, this can all be easily modified. 


Furthermore, these macros are called *Sub.C because they contain a sub-plot
beneath the main histogram which indicatees the N_poisson difference 
between data and MC in each bin. (N_data - N_MC)/sqrt(N_data). 


To run a macro, just do:

    root -b MakePlotsMuNuSub.C
    
    
The "-b" is for batch mode, so the plot X Windows don't pop up and slow
things down. Plots will output to the Plots_MuNuSub or Plots_MuMuSub 
directory. 

Note: There seems to be a graphical problem in ROOT version 5.27 which
is default for many CMSSW releases, in which stacked histograms do not
appear "stacked" -> layers are visible beneath one another. You can
reset to Root 5.26 with the commands in Root526Reset.txt.
