1) The main file to run is GetRecoilBins.C
   > root -l
   > root [0] .x GetRecoilBins.C+



2) This file runs on post-analysis level root files which store just the esstential variables for the last stage of analysis. 
  - such files can be found at:
    /castor/cern.ch/user/d/darinb/AnalysisData/March17

   file locations for these variables are specified at the very top of the .C file.

3) This file will output plots in a plots/fits and plots/gaus directory. The former plots of fits. The latter stores the individual gaussian distributions. Please make these directories in the directory where you run GetRecoilBins.C

4) There will be an output file RecoilBinLog.txt that gives the fit paramters for the correction equations. 

5) Using those paramters one can rerun the WJets RootTuples with corrections implemented. An example of the C/h scripts (which are just of the MakeClass variety) is in /UserCode/baumgartel/LQ/NTupleAnalyzer_Basic. 

  a) From these you can take the corrected functions like "float F_U1Prime(float P)" in line 19-39, which will return a U1 and U2 value given an input of P, the W boson Pt. 

  b) The calculations of the corrected U1 and U2 are implemented in line 1331-1388. Some variables used here are defined earlier in the code in the Gen-Level addon area, since the gen level neutrino is used. So you can find these in lines 929-1128
