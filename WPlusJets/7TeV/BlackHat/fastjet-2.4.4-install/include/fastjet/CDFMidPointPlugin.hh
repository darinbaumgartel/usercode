/// CDFMidPointPlugin is a plugin for fastjet (v2.1 upwards) that
/// provides an interface to the CDF version of Run-II iterative cone
/// algorithm with midpoint seeds (also known as the Iterative Legacy
/// Cone Algorithm, ILCA).
///
/// The CDF code has been taken from Joey Huston's webpage
/// http://www.pa.msu.edu/~huston/Les_Houches_2005/Les_Houches_SM.html
///
/// Note that the CDF midpoint code contains options that go beyond
/// those described in the Tevatron run-II document (hep-ex/0005012),
/// notably search-cones, as described in hep-ph/0111434, and
/// midpoints bewteen multiplets of stable cones.
///
/// Additionally, the version of the CDF midpoint code distributed
/// here has been modified by the FastJet authors, so as to allow one
/// to choose the scale used in the split-merge step.
//
//----------------------------------------------------------------------

public:
  /// the choice of scale to be used in the split-merge step
  // NB: just replicates what we've added to the CDF midpoint code
  enum SplitMergeScale {SM_pt, SM_Et, SM_mt, SM_pttilde};

  ///
  /// A CDFMidPointPlugin constructor that looks like the one provided
  /// by CDF. Its arguments should have the following meaning:
  ///
  /// - seed_threshold: minimum pt for a particle to be considered 
  ///   a seed of the iteration.
  ///
  /// - cone_radius: standard meaning
  ///
  /// - cone_area_fraction: stable-cones are searched for with a
  ///   radius Rsearch = R * sqrt(cone_area_fraction), and then
  ///   expanded to size R afterwards; note (hep-ph/0610012) that this
  ///   introduces IR unsafety at NLO for X+2-jet observables (where X
  ///   any hard object).
  ///
  /// - max_pair_size: "midpoints" can be added between pairs of
  ///   stable cones, triplets of stable cones, etc.; max_pair_size
  ///   indicates the maximum number of stable cones that are
  ///   assembled when adding midpoints.
  ///
  /// - max_iterations: the maximum number of iterations to carry out
  ///   when looking for a stable cone.
  ///
  /// - overlap_threshold: if
  ///     (overlapping_Et)/(Et_of_softer_protojet) < overlap_threshold,
  ///   overlapping jets are split, otherwise they are merged.
  ///
  /// - sm_scale: a choice for the scale to be used in the split-merge
  ///   step (both for ordering the momenta and quantifying the
  ///   overlap); the three options are
  ///
  ///    . SM_pt: pt (default -- source of small IR safety issue in purely
  ///      hadronic events)
  ///
  ///    . SM_Et: Et (not boost invariant, reduces to mt at zero rapidity and
  ///      to pt and infinite rapidity)
  ///
  ///    . SM_mt: transverse mass = sqrt(m^2+pt^2)
